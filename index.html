<h2 id=about>About</h2>
<p>I am a PhD student in economics at MIT specializing in labor and monetary economics. Broadly speaking, I am interested in how changing social institutions affect economic development. My research combines fieldwork, quasi-experimental evidence, and economic theory to provide illuminating case studies. I am on the 2021-2022 academic job market and available for interviews.</p>
<p>Here is my <strong><a href=http://economics.mit.edu/grad/mbwong/cv>CV</a></strong>. You can reach me at <a href=mbwong@mit.edu>mbwong@mit.edu</a>.</p>

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=http://economics.mit.edu/files/22108 target=blank>Labor Market Consequences of Domestic Outsourcing: Evidence from Legalization in Brazil</a></h3>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Mayara Felix)</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: November 2021</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px"><em>Job Market Paper</em></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(0)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_0> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_0 style=display:none>: We analyze the effect of domestic outsourcing on labor markets using Brazil's unexpected legalization of outsourcing in 1993, which sharply increased outsourcing among security guards. We show that outsourcing legalization led to a wave of occupational layoffs. Incumbent security guards affected by the layoffs moved to lower-wage firms and experienced persistent wage reductions. However, outsourcing legalization also had positive market-level effects, as revealed by a triple-difference specification that uses regional variation in the pre-legalization permissiveness of labor courts and compares security guards with less impacted occupations. Jobs were reallocated from older to younger workers. Total employment of security guards rose by 8-15% and their average wages increased by 2-4%. Interpreted through an economic framework, the results imply that outsourcing legalization benefitted entrant workers and generated lasting efficiency gains. If laid-off incumbent workers were fully compensated for their earnings losses, social breakeven would be achieved in one to five years.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=http://economics.mit.edu/files/22266 target=blank>The Power of Money: Lessons from Introducing Digital Currency to a Barter Community</a></h3>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: October 2021</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(1)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_1> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_1 style=display:none>: I study the role of money as a medium of exchange by analyzing how digital currency issuance by a private online platform affected the volume of trade in a large barter community in Toronto. The community initially banned cash, but subsequently introduced a digital token that could be transferred among users and redeemed at designated local stores for retail goods. Using comprehensive transactions data, I show that a large monetary expansion persistently increased transaction volume by 70% by enabling monetized trade. However, when token redemption was suddenly halted at a subset of stores, a run on the token ensued and transaction volume fell. The findings are consistent with a search-theoretic model wherein the use of money solves the problem of double coincidence.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=http://economics.mit.edu/files/22163 target=blank>The Effects of Partial Public Housing Privatization: Evidence from Hong Kong</a></h3>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: December 2021</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(2)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_2> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_2 style=display:none>: To boost homeownership, many governments sell public housing to sitting tenants but limit the resale and leasing of sold units. What is the impact of this partial privatization? I estimate the effects of Hong Kong’s Tenants Purchase Scheme using its staggered rollout across housing estates in 1998-2006. I find that total population and average household size fell in treated estates, while average household income rose. These findings are not explained by reallocation of housing units across households, which was rare due to stringent resale and leasing restrictions. Rather, the program relaxed household-size-contingent income limits and unit allocation rules for sitting tenants, which caused some household members to move out and others to increase labor supply.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=http://economics.mit.edu/files/21784 target=blank>Ideological Bias and Trust in Information Sources</a></h3>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Matthew Gentzkow and Allen T. Zhang)</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: August 2021</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(3)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_3> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_3 style=display:none>: We study the role of endogenous trust in amplifying ideological bias. Agents in our model seek to learn a sequence of states using information from sources whose accuracy is ex ante uncertain. Agents rely on noisy feedback about the state from direct experience to learn the accuracy of sources. Small biases in this feedback can cause large ideological differences in the agents’ trust in information sources and their beliefs about the states, and may lead agents to become overconfident in their own judgment. Disagreements can be similar in magnitude whether agents see only ideologically aligned sources or see a diverse range of sources.
