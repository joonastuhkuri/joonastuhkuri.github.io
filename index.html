Evidence from Introducing Digital Currency to a Barter Community</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: February 2022</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(0)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_0> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_0 style=display:none>: I analyze how digital currency issuance by a private online platform affected the volume of trade in a large barter community in Toronto. The community initially banned cash, but subsequently introduced a digital token that could be transferred among users and redeemed at designated local stores for retail goods. Using comprehensive transactions data, I show that a large monetary expansion persistently increased transaction volume by 70% by enabling monetized trade. However, when token redemption was suddenly halted at a subset of stores, a run on the token ensued and transaction volume fell. The findings are consistent with a search-theoretic model wherein money functions as a medium of exchange.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://twitter.com/mbwong/status/1453385579308195842?s=20&t=2KZ23wzUGzl9ViykC8gzFg" target=blank>Twitter thread</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/outsourcing.pdf target=blank>Labor Market Consequences of Domestic Outsourcing: Evidence from Legalization in Brazil</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Mayara Felix)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: December 2021</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(1)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_1> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_1 style=display:none>: We analyze the effect of domestic outsourcing on labor markets using Brazil's unexpected legalization of outsourcing in 1993, which sharply increased outsourcing among security guards. We show that outsourcing legalization led to a wave of occupational layoffs. Incumbent security guards affected by the layoffs moved to lower-wage firms and experienced persistent wage reductions. However, outsourcing legalization also had positive market-level effects, as revealed by a triple-difference specification that uses regional variation in the pre-legalization permissiveness of labor courts and compares security guards with less impacted occupations. Jobs were reallocated from older to younger workers. Total employment of security guards rose by 8-15% and their average wages increased by 2-4%. Interpreted through an economic framework, the results imply that outsourcing legalization benefitted entrant workers and generated lasting efficiency gains. If laid-off incumbent workers were fully compensated for their earnings losses, social breakeven would be achieved in one to five years.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://twitter.com/mbwong/status/1452659761300844546 target=blank>Twitter thread</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/TPS.pdf target=blank>The Effects of Partial Public Housing Privatization: Evidence from Hong Kong</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: June 2022</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><em>Under review</em></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(2)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_2> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_2 style=display:none>: Many governments sell public housing to sitting tenants but limit the resale and leasing of sold units. What is the impact of this partial privatization? I present quasi-experimental evidence that fifteen years after its introduction, Hong Kong’s Tenants Purchase Scheme reduced household sizes in treated estates by 7 percent and increased household incomes by 23 percent. There was little reallocation of housing across households, however. These effects are instead driven by the relaxation of household-size-contingent income limits and unit allocation rules, which increased labor supply and altered household composition.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/trust.pdf target=blank>Ideological Bias and Trust in Information Sources</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: August 2021</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><em>Revise and resubmit, AEJ: Micro</em></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(3)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_3> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_3 style=display:none>: We study the role of endogenous trust in amplifying ideological bias. Agents in our model seek to learn a sequence of states using information from sources whose accuracy is ex ante uncertain. Agents rely on noisy feedback about the state from direct experience to learn the accuracy of sources. Small biases in this feedback can cause large ideological differences in the agents’ trust in information sources and their beliefs about the states, and may lead agents to become overconfident in their own judgment. Disagreements can be similar in magnitude whether agents see only ideologically aligned sources or see a diverse range of sources.</span></p><hr><h2 id=workinprogress>Work in Progress</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">The Employment Dynamics of Outsourced Workers</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Duoxi Li)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Outsourcing, Specialization, and Relational Contracts</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Duoxi Li)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">What Caused Hong Kong's Housing Crisis?</h3><hr><h2 id=teaching>Teaching</h2><p><strong>Upcoming</strong>: Instructor for HKU&rsquo;s PMGM7004 (Global Management from Economics Perspectives) and PMGM7019 (Economics of Strategy and Organization).</p><p><strong>Previous</strong>: TA for MIT&rsquo;s Intro Micro (undergrad, 2022), Intermediate Micro (undergrad, 2018-20), Applied Econ for Managers (EMBA, 2019), Org Econ (PhD, 2018), and Industrial Organization II (PhD, 2022).</p><hr><h2 id=other>Other</h2><p><a href=./pdf/Things_I_learned_in_Grad_School.pdf>Things I learned in Grad School (the Hard Way)</a></p></section><footer></footer></div><script src=./js/scale.fix.js></script>
