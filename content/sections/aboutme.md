Thank you for visiting my website! I am a PhD student in economics at MIT. I am a labor economist with a secondary interest in monetary economics. I am particularly interested in how changes in economic organization affect welfare, social mobility, and inequality. I am on the 2021-2022 academic job market and available for interviews.
