I'm an economist (PhD,[MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/)) based in Berlin and an Assistant Professor of Economics at at [Stockholm University] (https://www.su.se/department-of-economics/) 2023-.  

My research focuses on technology, work, skills, and psychological traits using novel large-scale data. My latest research, documents that technology investments in manufacturing led to increases in employment, contrasting with the common concerns about the future of work. I previously created a real-time forecast ETLAnow that predicts unemployment using Google search data.

My research has been featured widely in the media, including The Economist, Washington Post, Wired, and Bloomberg. HS Visio listed me in their 35 under 35 in Finland.
