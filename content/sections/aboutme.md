I will join [HKU](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/) this fall as an assistant professor in economics, management and strategy. I am interested in theory-informed quasi-experimental approaches to labor and monetary economics. Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@mit.edu](mailto:mbwong@mit.edu) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong) or [Wechat](weixin://dl/chat?mblwong). 

If you're an undergrad or grad student, I will be hiring RAs (mostly part-time). Email me if interested!
