I'm an economist (PhD, [MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/)) and an Assistant Professor of Economics at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/department-of-economics/) from 2023.   Currently, I'm based in Berlin at the new [Rockwool Foundation Berlin](https://www.rfberlin.com/) and a Senior Fellow at [Etla](https://www.etla.fi/en/).

My [research](/#workingpapers) focuses on technology, work, and psychology using novel large-scale data. For example, I document that firms' adoption of advanced technologies increased employment; contrasting with common concerns about the future of work. I've also created a real-time forecast [ETLAnow](https://www.etla.fi/en/etlanow/) that predicts unemployment using Google search data.

The media has featured my research widely, including in the [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/22/economists-are-revising-their-views-on-robots-and-jobs), Washington Post, and Wired. My PhD thesis was awarded the [W.E. Upjohn Institute Award](https://www.upjohn.org/2022-Dissertation-Awardees), and HS listed me in their [35 under 35](https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000007825436.html).
