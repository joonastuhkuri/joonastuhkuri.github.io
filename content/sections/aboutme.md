I am a PhD student in economics at MIT specializing in labor and monetary economics. Broadly speaking, I am interested in how changing social institutions affect economic development. My approach combines fieldwork, quasi-experimental evidence, and economic theory to provide illuminating case studies. I am on the 2021-2022 academic job market and available for interviews.
