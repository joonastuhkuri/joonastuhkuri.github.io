I am a PhD student in economics at MIT specializing in labor and monetary economics. Broadly speaking, I am interested in how social institutions shape economic organization. My current research combines fieldwork, quasi-experimental evidence, and economic theory to shed light on domestic outsourcing and the nature of money. I am on the 2021-2022 academic job market and available for interviews.
