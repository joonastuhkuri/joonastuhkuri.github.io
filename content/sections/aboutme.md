I'm an economist (PhD, [MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/)) and an Assistant Professor of Economics at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/department-of-economics/). I'm also a Senior Fellow at [Etla](https://www.etla.fi/en/), and a Research Affiliate at [IZA](https://www.iza.org/).

My [research](/#workingpapers) focuses on technology, work, and psychology using novel large-scale data. My latest work documents that when firms adopted advanced technologies they increased employment—contrasting with common concerns about the future of work. 

The media has featured my research widely, including in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/22/economists-are-revising-their-views-on-robots-and-jobs) and Wired. My PhD thesis received the [Upjohn Institute Award](https://www.upjohn.org/2022-Dissertation-Awardees) and the main Finnish newspaper, HS, listed me in their [35 under 35](https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000007825436.html). I've also created a real-time forecast ETLAnow that predicts unemployment using Google search data.
