I'm an economist (PhD, [MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/)) and an Assistant Professor of Economics at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/department-of-economics/) from 2023.   Currently, I'm based at the new [RF Berlin](https://www.rfberlin.com/), a Senior Fellow at [Etla](https://www.etla.fi/en/), and a Research Affiliate at [IZA](https://www.iza.org/).

My [research](/#workingpapers) focuses on technology, work, and psychology using novel large-scale data. For example, my latest work documents that when firms adopted advanced technologies they increased employment—contrasting with common concerns about the future of work. I've also created a real-time forecast [ETLAnow](https://www.etla.fi/en/etlanow/) that predicts unemployment using Google search data.

The media has featured my research widely, including in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/22/economists-are-revising-their-views-on-robots-and-jobs) and Wired. HS listed me in their [35 under 35](https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000007825436.html) and my PhD thesis received the [Upjohn Institute Award](https://www.upjohn.org/2022-Dissertation-Awardees).
